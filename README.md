# ITDocuApp
This is a documentation app that was built to sort out documentation for techs who need to find quick resolutions for problems that our users are having.

ERRORS ENCOUNTERED:

1.  Encountered GitHub merge conflicts.  I was about two changes in, and created a new repository.  I had to make sure that changes were only made locally and NOT in GitHub, as it causes these conflicts.
2.  When testing the 'update' feature, only send the properties and not the entire data set

THINGS LEARNED:

1. Creating and starting Express server
2. Creating a database in MongoDB and connecting to it
3. Using the '.gitIgnore' file to keep from sending the contents of '.env' file to the repository
4. Creating models that represent the data structure and core logic of application
5. CRUD functionality via Express routing
6. Creating middleware to parse incoming requests
